The 3DPlan algorithm was developed during my diploma thesis at the School of Rural and Surveying Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens, 
entitled "Automated detection of edges in point clouds using semantic information", which is available at https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/53090.
